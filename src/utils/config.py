# Research solutions are scored by the total cost of all aspects used in the solution.
# By default, all the primal aspects cost 1, all other aspects cost the sum of their components
# Example:
#   - aqua and terra are primal, so they cost 1 each
#   - victus = aqua + terra, so it costs 2
#   - herba = terra + victus, so it costs 3
# You can override these defaults like this, one entry per line (without the #):
# instrumentum = 1
